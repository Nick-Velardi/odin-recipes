      Here's a list of ingredients and directions on how to cook allrecipe.com's
      "Juicy Lucy" burger.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>4 slices American cheese (such as Kraft®)</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and pepper in a
        large bowl; mix well. Form 8, thin patties from the beef. Each patty
        should be slightly larger than a slice of cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut each slice of American cheese into 4 equal pieces; stack the pieces.
        Sandwich one stack of cheese between 2 ground beef patties. Tightly
        pinch edges together tightly seal the cheese within the meat. Repeat
        with the remaining cheese and patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat a cast-iron or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat.
        Cook burgers until well browned, about 4 minutes. It is common for
        burgers to puff up due to steam from the melting cheese. Turn burgers
        and prick the top of each to allow steam to escape; cook until browned
        on the outside and no longer pink on the inside; about 4 minutes. Serve
        on hamburger buns.
